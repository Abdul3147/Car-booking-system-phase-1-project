**Project Name: VehicleBooker**

**Problem Statement:**

Users need a simple and efficient way to search for various types of vehicles (cars, buses, motors), view images of these vehicles, and book or cancel trips. The current process is often fragmented across multiple platforms, leading to user frustration and inefficiency.

**Solution:**

VehicleBooker is a single-page web application that integrates vehicle search, image visualization, and booking functionality into one seamless interface. It utilizes the Unsplash API for high-quality vehicle images and a local JSON server for managing bookings.

**Features:**

Vehicle Search: Users can search for cars, buses, or motors using a simple search bar.

Image Display: The application fetches and displays relevant vehicle images from Unsplash.

Booking System: Users can book a vehicle with a single click.

Cancellation: Booked trips can be easily cancelled.

Confirmation Modal: A pop-up modal confirms successful bookings.

Persistent Data: Bookings are stored in a JSON server, allowing for data persistence.

Responsive Design: The interface is designed to work well on various screen sizes.

Real-time Updates: The UI updates immediately upon booking or cancellation without page reloads.

This solution provides a user-friendly, efficient way for people to search for, view, and book vehicles all in one place, addressing the need for a consolidated vehicle booking platform.
